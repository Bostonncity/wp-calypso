Our Approach to Data
====================

Throughout Calypso's development, our approach to handling data has evolved to allow us to better adapt to the scale at which the application has grown. These shifts have not been unanimously adopted throughout the codebase, so you'll occasionally encounter legacy code which is not consistent with our current recommendations. The purpose of this document is to outline a history of these approaches such that you as the developer can understand the differences between each. Further, it seeks to prescribe our current set of recommendations with regard to data management.

## History

There have been three major "eras" of data management throughout the lifetime of Calypso's development. Below, you will find a description of each, common identifying features, and reasons it was adopted in favor of the previous approach.

### Era One: Emitter Objects (June 2014 - April 2015)

Our original approach to managing data took an object-oriented approach, wherein an instance of the store would inherit the [`EventEmitter` interface](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_inheriting_from_eventemitter). Typically, a single instance of each object store was shared across the entire application. The instance was responsible for storing data, but included conveniences to automatically fetch data if none currently existed. Used in combination with the [`data-observe` mixin](../client/lib/mixins/data-observe), a developer could monitor an instance of the store passed as a prop to a React component to automatically re-render its contents if the store emitted a `change` event.

__Identifying features:__

- Module directories live in `lib` and are suffixed with `-list`
- Index file exports a common shared instance of the object prototype
- A `list.js` file includes the object prototype methods
- The list contains a `get` method which triggers a fetch if no data exists
- Used with the [`data-observe` mixin](../client/lib/mixins/data-observe) in a React component

### Era Two: Facebook Flux (April 2015 - December 2015)

Facebook's [Flux architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) is a pattern that encourages a [unidirectional data flow](https://facebook.github.io/flux/img/flux-simple-f8-diagram-explained-1300w.png) in which stores can only be manipulated via actions dispatched by a global dispatcher object. The raw data is never exposed by the store module, and as such, data can only be accessed by using helper ("getter") methods from the exported object. Similar to the event emitter object approach, a Flux store module inherits from the [`EventEmitter` interface](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_inheriting_from_eventemitter), though by convention, a store should only ever emit a `change` event (this was common but not as strictly enforced in our emitter objects). Stores subscribe to the dispatcher and listen for actions it is concerned with. Action creators are responsible for dispatching these actions. As an example, it is common to have an action creator that triggers a fetch for data - this action creator would dispatch a `FETCH_` prefixed "view" action upon the initial request, then subsequently a `RECEIVE_` prefixed "server" action upon receiving the data. Any store in the application could react to one or both of these action types.

__Identifying features:__

- Module directories live in `lib`
- Modules contain `actions.js` and at least one store (named or suffixed `store.js`)
- Actions dispatch view or server actions on the global `Dispatcher` object
- Stores include a top-level object for data storage, which is not directly exported
- Stores export a number of helper getter functions for accessing known data
- Stores register on the Dispatcher object, manipulating data in response to action types it is concerned with

__Advantages:__

- Stores can be specialized to their specific needs since dispatched actions are run against all subscribing stores
- There is a single entry point by which data can enter the store. This is easier to manage as an application scales
- Data logic (e.g. fetching) is not intertwined with the storage of the data
- Adopting an accepted pattern grants us access to a community-driven ecosystem of reference implementations

### Era Three: Redux Global State Tree (December 2015 - Present)

[Redux](http://redux.js.org/), described as a "predictable state container", is an evolution of the principles advocated in Flux. It is not a far departure from Flux, but is unique in many ways:

- There is typically only a single store instance, which maintains all state for the entire application
- Action creators do not call to the global dispatcher directly, but rather return simple action objects which can be passed to the [store `dispatch` method](http://rackt.org/redux/docs/api/Store.html#dispatch)
- While Flux Stores are responsible for maintaining own state, Redux reducers are composable functions that manipulate specific parts of the global state "tree"
- Since state is the [single source of truth](http://rackt.org/redux/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html#single-source-of-truth) for the entire application, reducers tend to be much simpler and transparent than Flux stores

__Identifying features:__

- Files exist within the `state` directory, mirroring the structure of the global tree
- React bindings use [`react-redux`](https://github.com/rackt/react-redux) `connect`

__Advantages:__

- An arguably simpler abstraction to the same problems addressed by Facebookâ€™s Flux implementation
- Better suited for server-side rendering, as the singleton nature of Flux stores exposes the risk of leaking session data between requests
- Encourages and often forces a developer toward writing functional, testable code
- Extendable, supporting middlewares to suit our specific needs and [conveniences for use with React](https://github.com/rackt/react-redux)
